# Image_Segmentation_Mask-RCNN
In this repsitory, we will see how to use a Mask R-CNN model from Tensorflow Hub for object detection and instance segmentation. This means that aside from the bounding boxes, the model is also able to predict segmentation masks for each instance of a class in the image.

The image that we're going to perform image segmentation on (the input image):
